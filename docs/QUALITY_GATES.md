# Quality Gates

This document defines FlowGo quality gates for pull requests, deep validation, releases, security review, and compatibility-sensitive changes. Agents use this policy to recommend checks and summarize evidence; maintainers decide whether advisory findings become merge-blocking.

## Gate Levels

| Level | Purpose | Blocking policy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Required PR gates | Fast checks expected for normal PRs. | Merge-blocking when configured as required status checks. |
| Optional/deep gates | Infrastructure, E2E, performance, or broader regression checks. | Advisory unless the changed surface requires them. |
| Release gates | Checks required before publishing a release candidate or final release. | Release-blocking. |
| Security gates | Secret, dependency, SAST, container, and CodeQL checks. | Blocking for high-confidence high/critical findings; advisory or maintainer-reviewed for lower-confidence findings. |
| Compatibility gates | Contract and migration checks for stable or user-facing surfaces. | Blocking when behavior changes without tests, docs, or maintainer approval. |

## Required PR Gates

Recommended required checks for default branch protection:

| Gate | Command or workflow | Expected artifacts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Go unit tests | `make test-unit` or CI Go Tests. | `reports/unit-raw.json`, `reports/coverage.out`, `reports/coverage.txt` when run locally. |
| BPMN matrix | `make test-bpmn-matrix`. | CI job output or local command output. |
| Frontend lint/test/build | `make test-frontend` for tests; CI also runs `npm --prefix frontend run lint` and `npm --prefix frontend run build`. | `reports/frontend-vitest.json`, `reports/frontend-vitest.txt`, build output. |
| Node.js SDK validation | `npm --prefix clients/nodejs-sdk test`, `npm --prefix clients/nodejs-sdk run validate:package`, `npm pack --dry-run`. | SDK test output, package validation output, dry-run package listing. |
| Compose profiles | `make smoke-profiles`. | Compose config validation output. |
| Helm validation | `make validate-helm`. | Helm lint/template output when Helm is installed; YAML parse validation otherwise. |
| Docker build and image scan | CI Docker Build Dry Run and Trivy image scan. | Docker build logs and Trivy results. |
| Security baseline | `.github/workflows/security.yml`. | Gitleaks, govulncheck, npm audit, gosec, Trivy filesystem, CodeQL where available. |

For lightweight local review, a maintainer or agent can start with:

```bash
make test-unit
make test-frontend
make smoke-profiles
make validate-helm
```

## Optional And Deep Gates

Run these when the changed surface warrants deeper confidence:

| Gate | Command | Use when |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Integration tests | `make test-integration` | API behavior depends on a running stack or cross-service behavior. |
| Backend E2E | `make test-e2e` | CQRS, worker, command-to-query, or runtime lifecycle behavior changes. |
| Full CQRS smoke | `make cqrs-e2e-smoke` | Event projection, Debezium/Kafka, sync worker, query visibility, or Elasticsearch/OpenSearch changes. |
| CQRS parity | `make cqrs-parity-check` | Read model counts, index mappings, or projection replay behavior changes. |
| Worker conformance | `make worker-conformance` | Worker API, SDK worker behavior, idempotency, headers, or job lifecycle changes. |
| Performance | `make test-perf` | Throughput, query performance, worker activation, polling, large variables, or hot paths change. |
| Full orchestrator | `make test-all` | Nightly, pre-release, or broad cross-system validation. |
| Release profile smoke | `make smoke-release-profiles` | Docker Compose release overlays or image tag behavior changes. |

`make test-all` starts the full CQRS stack, runs unit/integration/E2E/frontend/performance/security layers, and writes `reports/summary.md`. Use `SKIP_PERF=true` or `SKIP_PLAYWRIGHT=true` only with an explicit reason.

## Release Gates

Before a release candidate:

```bash
make smoke-profiles
make smoke-release-profiles
make validate-helm
make release-dry-run
```

Also verify:

- CI and Security workflows pass on the release commit.
- Node SDK tests, package validation, `npm pack --dry-run`, and SBOM generation pass.
- Docker image release workflow produces build metadata, scan results, SBOM/provenance, and signatures when publishing is enabled.
- Release notes include changelog summary, known limitations, compatibility notes, upgrade notes, Docker image references, npm package version, and security notes.

Release gates are blocking for release publication. A maintainer may accept a known limitation only if it is documented in release notes and does not violate the security policy.

## Security Gates

Security gates include:

| Gate | Source | Blocking rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Secret scan | Gitleaks in `.github/workflows/security.yml`. | Block confirmed secrets or credentials. |
| Go vulnerabilities | `govulncheck` and `make test-security`. | Block reachable high/critical vulnerabilities unless a documented maintainer exception exists. |
| npm vulnerabilities | npm audit for `frontend` and `clients/nodejs-sdk`. | Block production high/critical vulnerabilities. |
| Go SAST | gosec in security workflow and `make test-security`. | Block high-confidence high severity findings; review medium findings. |
| Container/filesystem scan | Trivy filesystem/image scans. | Block high/critical findings in release images or required CI scans. |
| CodeQL | Security workflow for public repositories. | Block actionable high/critical alerts after maintainer review. |
| Dependency updates | Dependabot and dependency policy. | Require review for runtime, auth, parser, Docker, GitHub Actions, and release tooling changes. |

Security agents must keep vulnerability details private when disclosure could harm users.

## Compatibility-Sensitive Surfaces

Changes to these surfaces require explicit compatibility review:

- Worker REST API and protocol headers.
- Node.js SDK public API and package metadata.
- Command and query HTTP response shapes.
- Docker image environment variables, exposed ports, and image names.
- Helm chart values and rendered Kubernetes resources.
- IAM role names, claim mapping, token validation, and authorization behavior.
- BPMN parser/runtime semantics.
- CQRS event payloads, outbox format, projection mapping, and read model states.

Expected evidence:

- Contract tests or conformance checks for the changed surface.
- Documentation updates in the relevant `docs/` file.
- Migration or deprecation notes for breaking changes.
- Maintainer approval for accepted compatibility risk.

## Expected Artifacts

Agents and maintainers should preserve or upload:

- `reports/summary.md`
- `reports/unit.md`, `reports/unit-raw.json`, `reports/coverage.txt`
- `reports/integration.md`, `reports/integration-raw.json`
- `reports/e2e.md`, `reports/e2e-*.txt`
- `reports/frontend.md`, `reports/frontend-vitest.json`, Playwright traces/screenshots/results
- `reports/performance.md`, `reports/k6.json`, `reports/perf-raw.txt`
- `reports/security.md`, scanner raw outputs, SARIF where available
- Release dry-run logs, SDK package dry-run output, SBOM/provenance files

Workflow summaries should include links to artifacts and a short pass/fail/skip table. If a gate did not run, record why.

## Merge-Blocking Vs Advisory Findings

Merge-blocking by default:

- Failing required CI or Security checks.
- Confirmed correctness bug in changed behavior.
- Missing test evidence for compatibility-sensitive changes.
- Confirmed secret, auth bypass, data exposure, or high/critical reachable vulnerability.
- Release or deployment changes without smoke/Helm validation.
- Public API/SDK/worker changes without docs or compatibility notes.

Advisory by default:

- Low-risk docs wording suggestions.
- Non-critical maintainability improvements.
- Optional coverage improvements unrelated to the changed behavior.
- Performance concerns without evidence of regression.
- Scanner findings that are unreachable, low severity, or require maintainer risk review.

Agents should label each finding as blocking, advisory, question, or follow-up and cite the evidence used.
