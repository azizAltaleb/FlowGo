## Suggested Gate Mapping

Use this section when relevant:

- Backend/runtime: `make test-unit`, plus `make test-bpmn-matrix` for BPMN behavior.
- Frontend: `make test-frontend`, plus build/lint evidence from CI.
- SDK: `npm --prefix clients/nodejs-sdk test`, package validation, and `npm pack --dry-run`.
- Deployment: `make smoke-profiles`, `make smoke-release-profiles`, `make validate-helm`.
- Worker API: `make worker-conformance`.
- CQRS/query/sync: `make cqrs-e2e-smoke` and `make cqrs-parity-check` when infrastructure behavior changes.
- Security-sensitive: `make test-security` and Security workflow review.
- Release-sensitive: `make release-dry-run`.
